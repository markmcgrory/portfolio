# Portfolio

This is my portfolio site, which I designed and built using React and vanilla CSS.

I worked on this after graduating from CodeClan in November 2023, and it taught me a lot about front-end development. I've finally got a solid grasp of responsive design. That feels like a big victory to me. I enjoyed discovering and utilising various React libraries like React Reveal (which I've probably overused) and React Image Gallery. And I was reminded of the importance of planning by not doing enough of it and regretting it later on.
